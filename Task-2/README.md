## 🎯 Objective
To build a predictive model that identifies customers at risk of churn and analyze the key factors influencing churn.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python — Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI

---

## 📊 Key Results
- **Total Customers:** 10,000  
- **Churned Customers:** ~2,037  
- **Churn Rate:** ~20%  

---

## 🔍 Key Churn Drivers
- Age  
- Number of products  
- Credit score  
- Balance & income  
- Customer activity status  
- Geography  

Inactive and single-product customers show higher churn risk.

- Churn Probability  
- Churn by Age Group  
- Churn by Country  
- Churn by Activity Status  
- Top Churn Drivers  

Dashboard file is available in the **dashboard folder**.
